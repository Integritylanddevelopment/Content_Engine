# Content Engine Setup – NLP & Personalization Mapping

1. What type of content does this product deliver? (therapy, journaling, prompts, affirmations, etc.)
2. Is this content daily, event-based, or triggered by user input?
3. Does the content need to adapt to personality, relationship, or behavioral data?
4. Do we want to run NLP tagging and emotional tone detection per response?
5. Should this engine evolve over time (adaptive AI), or stay fixed?

Once answered, Eloi will construct the prompt engine, NLP tagging structure, and personalization mapping model.
